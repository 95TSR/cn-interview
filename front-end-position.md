#### Time

We expect you finish your work in 1 week. But it doesn't mean you can't spend more than 1 week. 1 week is an expectation for us thinking how hard it is and how much time you can spend for the test.

## What we care 

There is no best solution for each tests, you can choose any library or tool you want. But please keep in mind we're interesting in your code and the way you thinking, not how you well use the framework/library. And we will take serious for the work every one did and make sure you will get the review fast and helpful.
